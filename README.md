The proposed project titled under UCR is “Large Scale Solar Power Project in Rajasthan” which is a
grid-connected solar power project. M/s RSWM Ltd is a solar power producer. The promoter of the
project activity is ‘M/s RSWM Ltd’ (hereinafter called as Project Proponent or PP). PP has the full
ownership of the project activity. This project is an operational activity with continuous reduction of
GHG, currently being applied under the “Universal Carbon Registry” (UCR).

The project activity involves Ground Mounted Multicrystalline Photovoltaic (PV) Plant having
installed capacity of ground mounted 8.8 MW at Banswara, ground mounted 6.75 MW &
Rooftop PV plant having capacity of 0.092 MW in Bhilwara district. The project activity uses
multicrystalline solar photovoltaic technology to generate clean energy. Solar radiation is
converted directly into electricity by solar cells (photovoltaic cells).

The project activity aims to harness Solar radiation of sun which is a renewable source, to
generate electricity. The net generated electricity from the project activity is consumed by the
manufacturing facility of the PP. The promoter of the project activity is ‘M/s RSWM Pvt Ltd.’
And has the 100% ownership of the project activity.

Project activity is displacing the gross electricity generation i.e., 103085 MWh from the
NEWNE grid, which otherwise would have been imported from the NEWNE grid.

Purpose of the project activity:
The purpose of the proposed project activity is to generate electricity using a clean and renewable source
of energy i.e., solar radiation. The proposed project activity of 15.642 MW is the installation and
operation of a solar power plant.

The verification work has been contracted by project aggregator M/s. Creduce Technologies
Pvt Ltd and M/s. RSWM Ltd. to perform an independent verification of its UCR project titled
“Large Scale Solar Power Project in Rajasthan” UCR approved project ID:356, to
establish a number of CoUs generated by the project over the crediting period from 01/02/2019
to 31/12/2022 (both days included).

Verification for the period: 01/02/2019 to 31/12/2022

It is certified that the emission reductions from the Large Scale Solar Power Project in
Rajasthan (UCR ID – 356) for the period 01/02/2019 to 31/12/2022 amounts to 92776 CoUs
(92776 tCO2e).
